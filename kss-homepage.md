## Branding and Component Library

### Overview

The Horizon Design System (HDS) is a flexible modular toolkit designed to evolve and unify NASA.gov. This system is built using an atomic design system approach, a modular approach to designing websites and digital products.

This branding and component library is a developer's guideline to the user interface, consists of three parts:

1. Core - The base for which all other elements, components, and modules are built upong, including guidance on layout, typography, and color.
2. Element - The building blocks that are used to create larger parts of the system, including basic HTML elements like form fields, links, and buttons.
3. Component - Simple groups of elements that combine to form a reusable unit.
4. Module - The largest building blocks of the system. Modules make up entire sections.
5. Layout - Templates with content added become the pages that visitors see on the NASA website.
